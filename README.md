## 💁 About
Happy is an application responsible for bringing happiness to children or young people in need.

Because your main idea is to be an orphanage collector, that is, the more registered orphanages, the greater our variety in transmitting happiness and love to those who need it most.

Now doing good has become even easier and more practical 😁!
